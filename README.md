# Hardhat Typescript Template

A quick template made for personal use to ease the headache of setting up config parameters when starting a new project.

It is particularly tuned to my preferences and project structure, but feel free to use it as well ðŸ˜„

> I intend to keep updating as I learn more and identify recurring project features.
